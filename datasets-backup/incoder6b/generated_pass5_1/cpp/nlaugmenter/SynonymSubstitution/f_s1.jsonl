Your code works perfectly for me. I am just wondering why my code doesn't work. Is it because my code is not using recursion?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYes, I believe so. Recursion is used to solve problems such as \"find the factorial of a number\", and your problem is a little bit more complicated than that. Your code is not using recursion, but it is using loops. I suggest you read more about recursion, and try to solve the problem using recursion.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for your advice.
