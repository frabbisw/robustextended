This works perfectly. One more question, how would I go about making the function more efficient? I understand that my code will run much faster if I use vectors, but I'm having trouble understanding how to implement it in this particular case.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nYou can try this one: https://ideone.com/aJZJXZ\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks so much!

I'm still trying to understand your solution. Can you explain what each of the `for` loops do? I understand that `a` and `b` are the arrays that hold the values of `i` and `j`, but what does `c` and `d` do? Also, what does `e` do? Finally, why do you use `&` when passing `a` and `b`? Thanks again.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI added comments to explain each of the loops. `c` and `d` are the arrays that hold the values of `i` and `j`. `e` is an array that holds the values of `i` and `j` when `a` and `b` are the same. `&` means \"address of variable\", so `&a` and `&b` mean \"address of `a` and `b`\".\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThanks for your answer.
