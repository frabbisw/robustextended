Can you please explain the logic behind your code? I understand that you are splitting the sentence into words and then you add each word to a new string but I don't understand why you use two for loops. Also why do you use two for loops instead of one? Thanks.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nI used two for loops because I thought that if you have two words in a sentence and you want to split them into two new strings you would have to loop through each word and add it to the new string.
