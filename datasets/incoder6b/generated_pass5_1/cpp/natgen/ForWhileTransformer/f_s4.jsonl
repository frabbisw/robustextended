Can you please explain why you used the pointers instead of just calling the function?\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThe pointers allow you to pass arguments by reference, instead of by value. This allows you to modify the arguments in the function without having to return a new value. For example, if you wanted to add two numbers without returning a new value, you could do `int add(int x, int y){return x + y;}` instead of `int add(int x, int y){return x + y;}`. You would then call it like `add(&x, &y)`.\n<|/ c |>\n<| c |>\nThank you for your answer.
