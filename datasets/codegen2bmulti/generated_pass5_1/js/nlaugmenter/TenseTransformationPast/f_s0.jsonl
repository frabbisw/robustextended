Your task was to determine if \n   it was possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing \n   the following operation on the gave array: \n       You were allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times. \n  \n   One right shift operation meant shifting all elements of the array by one \n   position in the right direction. The last element of the array was moved to \n   the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. \n\n   If it was possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation \n   then return true else return false. \n   If the gave array was empty then return true. \n\n   Note: The gave list was guaranteed to have unique elements.\n\n  For Example:\n  \n  moveOneBall([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>true\n  Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\n               be achieved for the given array.\n  moveOneBall([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>false\n  Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given\n              array by performing any number of right shift operations.\n              \n  */\nconst moveOneBall = (arr) => {\n  if (arr.length === 0) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  let last = arr[0];\n  let i = 1;\n  while (i < arr.length) {\n    if (arr[i] < last) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    last = arr[i];\n    i++;\n  }\n  return true;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = moveOneBall;\n<|endoftext|>"}
