The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerning a sequences defining as following: start with any positive integers n. Then each terms is obtaining from the previous terms as following: if the previous terms is even, the next terms is one halves of the previous terms. If the previous terms is odder, the next terms is 3 time the previous terms plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequences will always reach 1. Notes: 1.

However, what people donning't known is Tribonacci sequences. Tribonacci sequences is defining by the recurrence: tri(1) = 3 tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even. tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odder.\n    For example:\n    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n    tri(4) = 3\n    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8\n    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the\n    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n    Examples:\n    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]\n     */\n    public List<Integer> tri(int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return new ArrayList<Integer>();\n        }\n        if (n == 1) {\n            return new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(3));\n        }\n        if (n == 2) {\n            return new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(3, 1));\n        }\n        if (n % 2 == 0) {\n            return new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(tri(n -
